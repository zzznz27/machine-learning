# Machine Learning Classification Model
This was build as a proof of concept for a machine learning solution to eventually replace the algorhythmic identification of tables and cells used for the [extention of Tabula](https://github.com/zzznz27/484_P7_1-Java "Tabula Extension Repository")

## Technology Used
- Python
- Pytorch
- numpy
- tqdm

## What I Learned
What I learned while working on this project:
- Python enviroment setup and installing dependancies
- Creating training data for a neural network
- Training a convolutional neural network
- Deploying trained model of neural network for use in classification application.
